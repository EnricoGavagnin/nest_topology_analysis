Author: 
Enico Gavagnin


This repository contains all the accompanying codes of the data analysis for the research project "Nest Topology Manipulation" by Enrico Gavagnin and Nathalie Stroeymeyt. The analysis comprises of two parts:

- Nest Selection:
  Informing the experimental design by identifying a pair of nests which maximise the decorrelation on certain network topologies. 
  
- Data Analyis:
  Analysis of the experiemntal results performed as part of the research project.
