# README - Nest Selection

This fodler contains a series of Python Jupyter notebooks to perform the artificial nest selection (see Section S1 of Materials and Methods). 

The process comprises two steps:

1. Designing of the Pool of artificial nests (P) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA). This is done in the notebook **HCA_analysis.ipynb**.
2. Selection of the experimental nest pairs (See Section S1.D of Material and Methods) which is done in the notebook **NEst_selection.ipynb**.
